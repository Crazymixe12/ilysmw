	  <li><p>The income per capita for developing countries in Asia in the early 70s were in
estimation of 1/10th in comparison to developed countries in the west. Economics
being the guiding factor for any enterprise and privately owned veterinary practices
were rarely seen.<p></li>  
		<li><p>Families were focused on sustaining their needs rather than their wants. The
public, hence did not regard veterinary care as a priority...although many people at
that time had adopted pets from the streets. These pets were kept entirely for utility
purposes i.e., dogs to guard properties and cats to rid off rats.<p></li>
		<li><p>On the other-hand people who owned pedigree pets were more profit-orientated
with their various breeding practices and hence welfare was not a valued
consideration at all.<p></li>
		<li><p>And because of the local scenario that ridiculed the veterinary profession, the
veterinarians themselves took a defensive stand and approached the science with
secondary and not primary health care in mind. Like any snowballing effect, the
morale of most veterinarians was low and the self-image of the profession was
relinquished.<p></li>
		<li><p>Due to the array of religious, traditions and Asian customs, compassion towards
animals was expressed through their own believes and taboos. On a positive note,
this was primarily the strong binding force that had slowly flourished the companion
animal industry in years to come.<p></li>
	<li><p>The whole scenario changed in the late 60's in Japan, when the veterinarians
decided to make routine trips for continuing education in the USA, thus bringing
back with them new philosophies to modernize the traditional practices in Japan.
Within a period of 20 years most practices in Japan had prioritized client education
in animal welfare. In doing so the human animal bond-interaction was sown and pets
became part of the family<p></li>
	<li><p>However even today, commitment towards animal welfare is still not very evident in
most developing countries primarily because of the lack of public awareness,
regarding responsible pet keeping. With the accessibility of mass media and the
Internet, information is readily available to a concerned owner whom had much
unanswered questions about their pet. This makes the role of a veterinarian more
holistic especially when he not only treats but also educates his clients with the
necessary facts to avoid any confusion and misinterpretations during client contact,
for the benefit of his patients. With more research and development constantly
undertaken in the field of animal behaviour, veterinarians are now solving more
behavioural problem than previously experienced. This will certainly be the key to
carry the veterinary profession into the forefront of animal welfare.<p></li>
