						<h4>DID YOU KNOW?</h4>
						<p>It’s easy to forget that in addition to being our entertaining and loving pets, our cats are also incredible athletes with fascinating anatomies. By taking a closer look at our cats’ bodies, we can appreciate their extraordinary nature even more.        Have you ever noticed how loose your cat's skin is? This is actually an advantage to cats in the wild – loose skin means that cats are flexible to move around quickly during confrontations. Around the ears, cats have specialized fur that helps them hear well and stay alert.</p>

				<p>Cats are born to be great hunters. So their muscles and strong hind legs allow them to stalk and pounce upon their prey with speed and accuracy. A cat's skull is also helpful in the hunt: cats have unusually large eye sockets that house a powerful set of eyes. Your cat’s eyes have a thin layer of cells in the retinas that reflect light back into the eye. This, along with the ability to dilate pupils extremely wide, makes your cat incredibly well-equipped for staying active in low-light situations, such as hunting or playing around the home. </p>
